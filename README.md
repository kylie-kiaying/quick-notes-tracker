# Quick notes tracker
A simple notes page that I created to practice on.

## Getting started
Open the project in your code editor and run the application:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
This will start the development server, and you can access the notes page at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.


## Usage
1. Type your note in the textarea.
2. Click the "Add" button or press Enter to add the note.
3. To add a new line within a note, press Shift + Enter.
4. Each note is displayed in a list format with a "Delete" button. Click the "Delete" button to remove a note.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite (for development and bundling)
